Interfaces for the PHP Content Repository PHPCR.

The JSR-283 [1] specification defines an API for a Content Repository (CR).
The PHP Content Repository Interfaces aim to provide that API in PHP.

There is a bunch of information here:

Port Status
***********
The PHPCR is following the Java Content Repository JCR API closely where
appropriate. In the points where Java and PHP differ, we tried to follow the
logic of PHP while keeping the spirit of the original API. The API has the same
expressivnes as the Java API.
Most of the JSR-283 documentation and code examples should be usable as-is.

Main differences between PHPCR and JCR are
* PHP has no method overloading. Same-name methods that differ only by
   parameter number and/or type have been merged into one method.
* PHP is weak typed, which makes the Value interface and the large number of
   almost-identical iterators obsolete.

A complete list of the differences between PHPCR and JCR is available at

History

TODO: evolution of JCR

The API was originally ported from Java to PHP by Karsten Dambekalns (k-fish)
with the help of others for the typo3/flow3 project.
